First attempt at a one button mobile game.  
Renamed from Project Bucket to Factory Flip.

This went really well all in all.  Considering I was learning UE4 on the fly, and using what I learned here to make another UE4 game with a different team I think this was a really good experience.  I even got experience adding models, and making UI.  I think this is done and worth showing off.
